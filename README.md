Attempt to use CSS Grid to create a design doc to house things like client creative brief, style guides, user research results, etc...

# purpose
Ever thought that design and user experience was super dope? Read a book or watched some video on it, maybe even went to some conference on the subject? Thought is was so amazing that you wanted everyone at work to get on board and make it a central part of all your dev and design processes - seeing how it would improve customer satisfaction and boost the company's bottomline? You did the hard work to get buy in from all the stakeholders and your dev work mates. Then everyone (including you) just kept doing what you always did - fell off the wagon so to speak? Well, this will be no more! Powered by CSS Grid Layouts, and a very best practices based methodology (what the hell does that mean), the power will be yours!
